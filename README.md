What was last kernel that booted on hardware XY?

The goal is of this project is to create a list of "known good" kernel
versions for given hardware.

That can be important information: when bringing up piece of
"interesting" hardware that should be supported by mainline kernel
(Nokia N810), it is much easier to start from known-good kernel and
known-good config, debug problems with bootloader, and then proceed to
newer kernel versions.

Oh and why Missy?
